Well, we've got some trainers here around Dawn's Landing that will share their knowledge of those arts with you - for some coin, of course. Go meet the lot of them, and I'll give you a reward for your troubles."
    completion: "<dark_green>Quest Master<white>: Great job! Remember where they are, and visit them if you need help with your skills. There are a few others around, too, if you want to go find them on your own time."
