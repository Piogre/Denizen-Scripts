Denizen-Scripts
===============

A collection of scripts I use with the Denizen plugin on my server. These files are provided as-is, with no warranty whatsoever. They are publicly posted for the benefit of the community as examples of ideas and logic implementations, but you may not copy this code without express written consent.

If you appreciate me maintaining this repo, please consider [backing me on Patreon.](https://www.patreon.com/summacrossroads) These files are designed for the Summa Crossroads Minecraft server, and if I'm unable to keep running it, I will stop maintaining the files and developing new ones.
